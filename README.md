# Hello-World-
Not another, but the first!
Name's Besim!
I just started learning coding, few weeks ago!
I'm happy that i started GitHub, it's a really good way of learning how to code, and share your projects with other people!
So i hope i can learn something from it, because i already like it!
Have a good day/night!
